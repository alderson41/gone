# Gone compiler

This is a compiler for a tiny programming language called *Gone*, implemented using Python 3.6, [SLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly) and [llvmlite](https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Gone is a very small language based on Go.

This compiler was developed as part of the January 2018 [Write a compiler](http://www.dabeaz.com/compiler.html) course, under the supervision of David Beazly.
